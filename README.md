## Quick Start

This guide will help you get the PushChain Racing Game running locally in under 10 minutes.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or higher) - [Download here](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Git** - [Download here](https://git-scm.com/)
- **MetaMask** browser extension - [Install here](https://metamask.io/) or Rabby wallet (recommended for smooth UX)
- **OR** Any wallet from any chain - Phantom (Solana), Coinbase Wallet, etc.

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd pushchain-racer-game
```

Set up .env file with private key (optional for contract redeployment)

```bash
# WalletConnect Project ID
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID="your_walletconnect_project_id"

# Push Chain Donut Testnet Configuration
PUSH_RPC_URL=https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org
PUSH_CHAIN_ID=42101

# Contract Addresses - Update these after deployment
VITE_RACING_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="racing_contract_address"
VITE_RACING_TOKEN_ADDRESS="token_contract_address"
VITE_TOURNAMENTS_CONTRACT_ADDRESS="tournament_contract_address"

# Private key for contract deployment (no 0x prefix)
PRIVATE_KEY="your_private_key"
```

### Step 2: Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all required packages including:
- React + TypeScript + Vite
- Push Chain SDK (`@pushchain/core`, `@pushchain/ui-kit`)
- Hardhat for smart contracts
- Web3 libraries (Wagmi, Viem)
- Three.js for 3D graphics

### Step 3: Understand the Two Connection Modes

#### Option A: Universal Wallet (Recommended) üåê
- **Connect from ANY chain** - Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, Base, etc.
- **No network switching required**
- Click "Universal Wallet" button on homepage
- Transactions are automatically routed through Push Chain

#### Option B: Direct Push Chain Connection
- **Traditional EVM wallet connection**
- Add Push Chain Donut Testnet to MetaMask/Rabby:

**Network Details:**
- Network Name: `Push Chain Donut Testnet`
- RPC URL: `https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org`
- Chain ID: `42101`
- Currency Symbol: `PC`
- Block Explorer: `https://donut.push.network`

### Step 4: Get Test Tokens

**For Universal Wallet Users:**
- No PC tokens needed! Use tokens from your origin chain
- Gas fees handled automatically

**For Direct Connection Users:**
1. Visit [Push Chain Faucet](https://faucet.push.org/)
2. Request test PC tokens for your wallet address
3. You'll need these tokens to interact with game contracts

### Step 5: Deploy Contracts (Optional)

If you want to deploy fresh contracts:

```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Deploy to Push Chain Donut Testnet
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-contracts.js --network pushDonut
```

**Note:** The game is already configured with pre-deployed contracts. The deployment script automatically updates the .env file.

### Step 6: Start the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

The game will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Step 7: Connect Your Wallet

**Universal Wallet Mode (Recommended):**
1. Open the game in your browser
2. Click "Universal Wallet" button
3. Choose your wallet from ANY chain
4. Sign the connection request
5. Start playing immediately!

**Direct Connection Mode:**
1. Click "Connect Wallet"
2. Select MetaMask/Rabby
3. Approve the connection
4. It will auto-connect to Push Chain or request network addition

### Step 8: Start Playing

1. **Mint your first car** - Click "Mint Starter Racer" on welcome page (0.01 PC)
2. **Enter a race** - Go to "Main Menu" and click "Start Race"
3. **Earn rewards** - Complete races to earn RACE tokens and XP
4. **Join tournaments** - Compete for PC prizes
5. **Collect & breed cars** - Build your NFT garage

   - Use the network details from Step 3

2. Import the network configuration:
   ```javascript
   {
     "chainId": "0xa475", // 42101 in hex
     "chainName": "Push Chain Donut Testnet",
     "rpcUrls": ["https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org"],
     "nativeCurrency": {
       "name": "PC",
       "symbol": "PC",
       "decimals": 18
     },
     "blockExplorerUrls": ["https://donut.push.network"]
   }
   ```

   - Falls back to direct connection

---

## Deployment Guide

### Prerequisites

1. **Node.js & npm** installed (v18+ recommended)
2. **A wallet** with private key
3. **Push Chain testnet tokens** from faucet
4. **Git** (optional, for version control)

### Step 1: Get Push Chain Testnet Tokens

Visit the Push Chain faucet to get testnet tokens:
- **Faucet**: https://faucet.push.org/
- **Block Explorer**: https://donut.push.network/

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

1. Copy the example environment file:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

2. Edit `.env` and add your configuration:
```env
# Your wallet private key (without 0x prefix)
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# Push Chain Donut Testnet RPC URL
PUSH_RPC_URL=https://evm.rpc-testnet-donut-node1.push.org

# Push Chain Donut Testnet Chain ID
PUSH_CHAIN_ID=42101

# WalletConnect Project ID
VITE_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID="your_walletconnect_project_id"
```

**SECURITY WARNING:** Never commit your `.env` file or share your private key!

### Step 3: Compile Contracts

Compile the smart contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat compile
```

This will compile:
- `RacingToken.sol` - ERC20 token (RACE tokens)
- `PushchainRacing.sol` - Main game contract (NFT cars & racing logic)
- `PushchainTournaments.sol` - Tournament system

### Step 4: Deploy to Push Chain Donut Testnet

Deploy all contracts:

```bash
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy-contracts.js --network pushDonut
```

The deployment script will:
1. Deploy RacingToken contract
2. Deploy PushchainRacing contract
3. Deploy PushchainTournaments contract
4. Link all contracts together
5. Set up proper permissions
6. Save deployment info to `deployment-split-contracts.json`
7. Update `.env` with contract addresses

### Step 5: Verify Deployment

After successful deployment, you should see output similar to:

```
‚úÖ RacingToken deployed to: 0x...
‚úÖ PushchainRacing deployed to: 0x...
‚úÖ PushchainTournaments deployed to: 0x...

üîó Linking contracts...
‚úÖ Token contract linked to Racing contract
‚úÖ Racing contract authorized to mint tokens
‚úÖ Tournament contract linked to Racing contract
```

Check your contracts on the Push Chain block explorer: https://donut.push.network/
